This is a launcher for the Android ril daemon in a glibc based environment. The daemon
itself is launched within the android system by the init daemon which sets up sockets for
communication and passed environment arguments to the daemon. This is now implemented as
part of the rild-launcher program.

On startup it create two sockets

/dev/socket/rild
/dev/socket/rild_debug 

which are used to communicate with the ril daemon.

Furhtermore it reads the properties rild.libpath and rild.libargs from the android
environment and add the needed arguments at launch of the ril daemon.

Starting the ril daemon now looks like this

# rild-launcher
